This is the demo ver for about we can use many features on UE4.

To start, first open the ../WindowsServer/FamilyReunionDinner2Server.exe to start the server.
Then, open WindowsNoEditor/FamilyReunionDinner2.exe to start the client.
Because this is the very early version, press "~" button on keyboard then enter the ip address shows
in ipconfig command in cmd or just entering 127.0.0.1 will probably be fine for entering the game
session

Currently, we have:
1. A kitchen scene
2. RPC functions to connect server and client
3. Press "T" key or "create card" button(need to move mouse something like using windows button) to create
the recipe card
4. When focusing one card, press "F" to let the card move up or down
5. Some simple usages of shader
